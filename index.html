                <h2>About PH Balloon Co</h2>
                <p>
                    <abbr title="PH Balloon Co">PHBC</abbr> was founded in 2022 as a creative outlet for the owner after being a keyworker during the lockdowns and to fill a gap in the events industry in Bolton. 
                    We hope you find all the event decor inspiration, guidance, and products you need here!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We cover a whole host of events, from seasonal and international 'days' (think Valentine's), to once in a lifetime events (because you only turn ten years old once, and it should be celebrated!).
                </p>

                        <summary>Are balloons environmentally friendly?</summary>
                        <p>The latex balloons we use are 100% natural, made from naturally occuring latex from the rubber plant, meaning they will biodegrade at around the same rate as a fallen leaf or other wood fibres. Despite this, their bright colours attract wildlife before they have chance to decompose. Those animals can mistake carelessly discarded balloons for food, so we still recommend disposing of them safely in general waste at the end of your event. For this reason, we will not supply balloons for use in 'balloon releases'.</p>
